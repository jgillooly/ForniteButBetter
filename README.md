# ForniteButBetter

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

This project was made to test our abilities with the Unreal Engine, as well as to test how well we could learn a new concept. This project is a multiplayer game that is like the hit game Fortnite. We made a building system, a weapons system, and most importantly a multiplayer system into the game. It might have a few issues because of the short time span it was created in, but overall I think it's pretty fun. 

Made by: Aiden Patrick, Max Flaugher, and Josh Gillooly
